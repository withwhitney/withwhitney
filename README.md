## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I am Whitney, currently working as a civil engineer. However, I am enthusiastic to break into the tech industry, especially the field of data science!

Here you will find some projects that I created using concepts that I learnt. Thank you very much for your time!
